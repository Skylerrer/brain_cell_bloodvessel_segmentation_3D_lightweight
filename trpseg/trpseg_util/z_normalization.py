    Parameters
    ----------
    input_folder_path: str, pathlib.Path
        The path to the folder containing the image slices to be normalized.
    output_folder_path: str, pathlib.Path
        The path to the folder where the normalized output images are stored
    min_tissue : int
        The minimal pixel intensity value considered for normalization.
        The value should ideally be chosen as the darkest brain tissue pixel intensity
        that is higher than the brightest pixel of the ventricle and the background.
    max_tissue : int
        The maximal pixel intensity value considered for normalization.
        This value should ideally be chosen as the brightest brain tissue pixel intensity
        excluding the marked pars tuberalis cells / tanycytes and blood vessels
    tissue_mean : int, float, optional
        The wanted tissue mean to which all images are normalized.
        If None, then the average tissue mean over the z_stack is automatically approximated.
    isTif : bool, optional
        Determines, which input images inside input_folder_path are considered.
        True, means that images have file type .tif
        False, means that images have file type .png
        None, means that all file types are considered
    channel_one : bool, optional
        Determines, which channel from the input images to use.
        True, means that only images containing the string "_C01_" are considered.
        False, means that only images containing the string "_C00_" are considered.
        None, means that all channels are considered.
    canceled : threading.Event, optional
        An event object that allows to cancel the process
    progress_status : PyQt6.QtCore.pyqtSignal
        A pyqtSignal that can be used to emit the current progress status


    Notes
    -------
    The normalization factor is determined by only looking at the brain tissue pixels. The brain tissue pixels are
    pixels with intensity values in the interval (min_tissue, max_tissue).

    The images are then multiplied by the factor (wanted_tissue_mean/current_image_tissue_mean).

    IMPORTANT: If you cannot find a good interval (min_tissue, max_tissue) that excludes the background,
    the ventricle and the high signal pixels (pars tuberalis cells/ tanycytes / blood vessels) then this method
    can not be used!
